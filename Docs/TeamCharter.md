# Team Charter


## Communication 
All communication will be done via slack. Meetings will be done via MS Teams weekly. The time and date will be determined  
In slack.

## Conflict Resolution
If a conflict arises, the team will discuss the issue to a resolution. If one cannot be reached we will take a vote.  
If issues persist, we will bring in the professor for mediation.

## Expectations
We are all non-traditional students with external responsibilities. We will do our best to communicate issues, but we all  
understand that things will come up and that we need to be flexible. 

## Responsibilities
Responsibilities will be assigned out on a weekly basis during meetings.
